        <p>Asphalt 9: Legends is a 2018 racing video game developed by Gameloft Barcelona and published by Gameloft. Released on July 25, 2018, it's the fifteenth major game of Asphalt series. In comparison to previous entries, there are several new and improved features, such as a prestigious car lineup, new control schemes, including the autopilot mode called "TouchDrive", and race modes, and the reimplemented "shockwave nitro" from Asphalt 6: Adrenaline. The graphics are considered significantly improved compared to its 2013 predecessor,The gameplay in Asphalt 9 is similar to the other Asphalt Games with noticeable differences in graphics and design. There were 48 cars featured in the game when soft-launched, but the worldwide release saw the introduction of four new cars, leading to 52 cars,In the game, there are four playing modes: Career, Multiplayer, Events, and Special Events (including Grand Prix). In career mode, the player participates in an extensive single-player campaign consisting of six chapters, each containing several series of races focusing on a certain car class or manufacturer, with more chapters set to be added. In Multiplayer, the player competes against other players in real-time asynchronous online multiplayer races. In Events, the player participates in a daily or weekly competition to beat other players' times or earn other items.

            There are also "Special Events", which were introduced with the Bugatti Chiron special event in December 2018, and have continued since with the introduction of "Drive Syndicate" events in July 2019 and, more recently, another special event released on July 31, 2020, starting with the SSC Tuatara. Since the "Godly Beasts Update", a new type of Special Event called "Grand Prix" has been launched, starting with the Techrules AT96 Track Edition Grand Prix. Players compete against other players for rewards, including the Key that allows the player to immediately unlock the featured Grand Prix car, though the car itself can still be "starred up" with blueprints.
